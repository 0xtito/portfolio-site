          I grew up in South Florida playing sports and always being with
          friends. I went to Saint Andrewâ€™s High School for academics and
          lacrosse. After an amazing 4 years, I went to Lehigh University to
          study Mechanical Engineering, however, two years in, I realized and
          accepted that I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but
          becoming a mechanical engineer and growing deeper in debt was the only
          thing I was certain I was not going to do. After leaving, I spent the
          next few years soul searching between jobs and hobbies, and ultimately
          ended up entangled in the world of crypto and software engineering.
          Now I spend my days coding, teaching children how to code, and
          learning all I can about whatever interests me.
